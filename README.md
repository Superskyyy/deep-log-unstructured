# Self-attentive classification-based anomaly detection in unstructured logs

This repository is the **unofficial** implementation of [Self-attentive classification-based anomaly detection in unstructured logs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338283&casa_token=aXQCQgTo9YYAAAAA:NJJhyLJgWfkeAjPCkMFAJYWmXyqLUk10u4RtYzT6HYVx0M-YZyq5nUU3BwyQt-GBgyTI51WYfGc&tag=1). 

>ðŸ“‹  Please find a demo Colab notebook at the src folder at project root

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  When using demo notebook, simply import the notebook along with the utils.py (data preprocessor) and modify the folder path to point to your [datasets](https://www.usenix.org/cfdr-data).

Baselines: We implemented two baselines used in the paper - PCA and Deeplog. Please refer to corresponding notebooks for their specifics.
 
## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

Run the notebook with TPU runtime and parallel execution strategy on, each epoch at batch size 512 will take less than 1min for first 5 million rows of data.

## Evaluation

The results can be evaluated by observing the F1-score, Recall, Precision and Accuracy. 

## Results [WIP]

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
